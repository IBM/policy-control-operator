# policy-control-operator
This is a PoC for [the design proposal of "Policy Control for KCP/Edge"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pdqbZa53b9No5q49KVmsQtpMcgBTZcThseoKbdJSapY).

In the design, we introduce an controller who runs on a cluster in a service provider and enables policy control functions on both KCP workspace level and the managed clusters. The service cluster (policy control operator cluster) is also bound to a dedicated workspace so users who define policies just interact with KCP and don't need to interact with individual managed clusters. In this PoC, we use [Operator Framework](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/) and choose [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) the engine of policy control.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster with ingress installed to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) and [KIND with Ingress](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/policy-control-operator:tag
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/policy-control-operator:tag KUSTOMIZE_VERSION=v4.5.7
```

3. Fill out [a Policy Control CR](./config/samples/pccr-template.yaml) and create the CR. Note that we assume KCP is running and one workspace is synced with a physical cluster. For example,

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/pccr-edge1.yaml
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
